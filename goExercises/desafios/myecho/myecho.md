# myecho app is a unix echo command clone. 

## Here you will find 3 implementations.

* Implementation 1: The most traditional usage of the `for` loop.
* Implementation 2: There's no `for` loops but use `strings` package and the `join` method to concatenate the command args with a separator.
* Implementation 3: short `for` loop  to iterate with array's ranges.

## Command line arguments 
All implementations also are used to demonstrate how to iterate with command line arguments.

Command line arguments can be acessed by variable os.Args from os package imported into the application.
